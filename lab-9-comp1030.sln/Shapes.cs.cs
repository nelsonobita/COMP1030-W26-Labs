    A Rectangle object will only require two properties, height and width (in characters) */

    When a new Rectangle object is instantiated, we will need to know (in integers) the height and width,

    The below functions are things that a Rectangle object can do - it can draw itself to the console,
    and it can return a string that describes itself */
